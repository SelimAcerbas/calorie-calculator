# How to calculate calories?
Calculating your daily caloric needs for maintenance, deficit (for fat loss), or surplus (for muscle building) involves several steps and factors. Here's a general guide to help you understand how to calculate these values:

1. Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
BMR is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic life-sustaining functions. It can be estimated using formulas like the Harris-Benedict equation. The equation differs based on gender:

For men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)
For women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years)
2. Factor in Physical Activity Level (PAL)
Your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is your BMR multiplied by an activity factor to account for your daily activities:

Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2
Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR × 1.725
Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & a physical job): BMR × 1.9

3. Determine Your Goal
Maintenance: This is your TDEE. To maintain your current weight, consume calories equal to your TDEE.
Deficit (Fat Loss): To lose fat, create a caloric deficit. A common recommendation is to consume 500 to 1000 calories less than your TDEE per day. This should result in a weight loss of about 0.5 to 1 kg per week.
Surplus (Muscle Building): To gain muscle, you need a caloric surplus. A surplus of 250 to 500 calories per day is often recommended. This supports muscle growth while minimizing fat gain.

4. Protein Intake
Protein is crucial for muscle building and preservation, especially in a caloric deficit. General guidelines for protein intake are:

Muscle Building:
1.8 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

Fat Loss while Preserving Muscle: Same as muscle building, or slightly higher to help preserve lean muscle mass.

5. Adjust Based on Progress and Feedback
Monitor your weight and body composition regularly. If you're not seeing the desired results, adjust your calorie intake accordingly.
Pay attention to how you feel. If you're constantly tired or hungry, you may need to adjust your calorie intake.

6. Balance of Carbohydrates and Fats
After setting your protein intake, allocate the remaining calories to carbohydrates and fats.
Carbs are important for energy, especially if you're active.
Healthy fats are essential for hormonal health and nutrient absorption.



# What are the meaning of constant values?
The constant values used in the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculations of the Harris-Benedict equation are empirically derived coefficients that account for the average metabolic rate of individuals based on their age, height, and weight. Here's a breakdown of these constants and their meanings:

For Men:
88.362: This is the base value for men. It represents the average base metabolic rate of men, independent of height, weight, and age.
13.397 × weight in kg: This coefficient represents the impact of a person's weight on their metabolic rate. The metabolic rate increases with weight, as a heavier body requires more energy to maintain.
4.799 × height in cm: This coefficient accounts for the impact of height on metabolic rate. Taller individuals have more body mass and surface area, which influences their energy needs.
5.677 × age in years: This coefficient accounts for the impact of age. Metabolic rate generally decreases with age.

For Women:
447.593: This is the base value for women, reflecting the average base metabolic rate for women, which is typically lower than for men.
9.247 × weight in kg: Similar to the men's equation, this represents the impact of weight on metabolic rate, but the coefficient is lower compared to men, reflecting generally lower muscle mass and higher body fat percentage in women.
3.098 × height in cm: This coefficient for height is lower than in men's, considering the differences in body composition and mass distribution.
4.330 × age in years: This coefficient for age is slightly lower than in men's, reflecting different rates of metabolic changes with age.
These constants are averages and may not perfectly represent individual variations in metabolic rates, which can be influenced by factors like muscle mass, body composition, genetic factors, and overall health.
